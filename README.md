## ðŸ“¦ What is PyFasma?

Raman spectroscopy is a versatile, label-free technique for probing molecular composition in biological
samples. However, the detection of subtle biochemical traits in high-throughput spectral datasets
requires careful preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and statistically sound analytical strategies. We
present PyFasma, an open-source Python package for Raman spectroscopy, integrating essential preprocessing tools (e.g., spike removal, smoothing, baseline correction, normalization), multivariate techniques
(PCA, PLS-DA), and spectral deconvolution within a modular, Jupyter Notebook-friendly framework. In
addition to describing the software, we demonstrate PyFasmaâ€™s capabilities through a practical biomedical
case study comparing Raman spectra from healthy and osteoporotic cortical bone samples. The results
revealed statistically significant differences in mineral-to-matrix ratio and crystallinity between assigned
groups, with PCA and PLS-DA successfully distinguishing pathological from normal bone spectra.
PyFasma encourages best practices in model validation, including the powerful but often overlooked,
repeated stratified cross-validation, enhancing the generalizability of multivariate analyses. It also offers an
easy-to-use, extensible solution for Raman data analysis, enabling the reproducible and robust interpretation of complex spectra of biological samples.
